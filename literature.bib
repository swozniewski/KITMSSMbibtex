  Abstract                 = {ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors. The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries. Its overall dimensions are 16 × 16 × 26 m³ with a total weight of approximately 10 000 t. The experiment consists of 18 different detector systems each with its own specific technology choice and design constraints, driven both by the physics requirements and the experimental conditions expected at LHC. The most stringent design constraint is to cope with the extreme particle multiplicity anticipated in central Pb-Pb collisions. The different subsystems were optimized to provide high-momentum resolution as well as excellent Particle Identification (PID) over a broad range in momentum, up to the highest multiplicities predicted for LHC. This will allow for comprehensive studies of hadrons, electrons, muons, and photons produced in the collision of heavy nuclei. Most detector systems are scheduled to be installed and ready for data taking by mid-2008 when the LHC is scheduled to start operation, with the exception of parts of the Photon Spectrometer (PHOS), Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) and Electro Magnetic Calorimeter (EMCal). These detectors will be completed for the high-luminosity ion run expected in 2010. This paper describes in detail the detector components as installed for the first data taking in the summer of 2008.},

  Abstract                 = {We discuss the theoretical bases that underpin the automation of the computations of tree-level and next-to-leading order cross sections, of their matching to parton shower simulations, and of the merging of matched samples that differ by light-parton multiplicities. We present a computer program, MadGraph5 aMC@NLO, capable of handling all these computations --- parton-level fixed order, shower-matched, merged --- in a unified framework whose defining features are flexibility, high level of parallelisation, and human intervention limited to input physics quantities. We demonstrate the potential of the program by presenting selected phenomenological applications relevant to the LHC and to a 1-TeV e + e − collider. While next-to-leading order results are restricted to QCD corrections to SM processes in the first public version, we show that from the user viewpoint no changes have to be expected in the case of corrections due to any given renormalisable Lagrangian, and that the implementation of these are well under way.},

  Abstract                 = {A Higgs-like particle with a mass of about 125.5 GeV has been discovered at the LHC. Within the current experimental uncertainties, this new state is compatible with both the predictions for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson and with the Higgs sector in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). We propose new low-energy MSSM benchmark scenarios that, over a wide parameter range, are compatible with the mass and production rates of the observed signal. These scenarios also exhibit interesting phenomenology for the MSSM Higgs sector. We propose a slightly updated version of the well-known {\$}m{\_}{\{}h{\}}^{\{}{\backslash}max{\}}{\$} scenario, and a modified scenario ( {\$}m{\_}{\{}h{\}}^{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}mod{\}}{\}}{\$} ), where the light {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}CP{\}}{\$} -even Higgs boson can be interpreted as the LHC signal in large parts of the M A --tan$\beta$ plane. Furthermore, we define a light stop scenario that leads to a suppression of the lightest {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}CP{\}}{\$} -even Higgs gluon fusion rate, and a light stau scenario with an enhanced decay rate of h{\textrightarrow}$\gamma$$\gamma$ at large tan$\beta$. We also suggest a $\tau$-phobic Higgs scenario in which the lightest Higgs can have suppressed couplings to down-type fermions. We propose to supplement the specified value of the $\mu$ parameter in some of these scenarios with additional values of both signs. This has a significant impact on the interpretation of searches for the non-SM-like MSSM Higgs bosons. We also discuss the sensitivity of the searches to heavy Higgs decays into light charginos and neutralinos, and to decays of the form H{\textrightarrow}hh. Finally, in addition to all the other scenarios where the lightest {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}CP{\}}{\$} -even Higgs is interpreted as the LHC signal, we propose a low-M H scenario, where instead the heavy {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}CP{\}}{\$} -even Higgs boson corresponds to the new state around 125.5 GeV.},

  Abstract                 = {At the Large Hadron Collider, the identification of jets originating from b quarks is important for searches for new physics and for measurements of standard model processes. A variety of algorithms has been developed by CMS to select b-quark jets based on variables such as the impact parameters of charged-particle tracks, the properties of reconstructed decay vertices, and the presence or absence of a lepton, or combinations thereof. The performance of these algorithms has been measured using data from proton-proton collisions at the LHC and compared with expectations based on simulation. The data used in this study were recorded in 2011 at √ s = 7 TeV for a total integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb -1 . The efficiency for tagging b-quark jets has been measured in events from multijet and t-quark pair production. CMS has achieved a b-jet tagging efficiency of 85% for a light-parton misidentification probability of 10% in multijet events. For analyses requiring higher purity, a misidentification probability of only 1.5% has been achieved, for a 70% b-jet tagging efficiency.},

At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter. The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4π solid angle. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values (|η| ≤ 5) assuring very good hermeticity.

  Abstract                 = {During autumn 2008, the Silicon Strip Tracker was operated with the full CMS experiment in a comprehensive test, in the presence of the 3.8 T magnetic field produced by the CMS superconducting solenoid. Cosmic ray muons were detected in the muon chambers and used to trigger the readout of all CMS sub-detectors. About 15 million events with a muon in the tracker were collected. The efficiency of hit and track reconstruction were measured to be higher than 99% and consistent with expectations from Monte Carlo simulation. This article details the commissioning and performance of the Silicon Strip Tracker with cosmic ray muons.},

  Abstract                 = {Weak and electromagnetic interactions of the leptons are examined under the hypothesis that the weak interactions are mediated by vector bosons. With only an isotopic triplet of leptons coupled to a triplet of vector bosons (two charged decay-intermediaries and the photon) the theory possesses no partial-symmetries. Such symmetries may be established if additional vector bosons or additional leptons are introduced. Since the latter possibility yields a theory disagreeing with experiment, the simplest partially-symmetric model reproducing the observed electromagnetic and weak interactions of leptons requires the existence of at least four vector-boson fields (including the photon). Corresponding partially-conserved quantities suggest leptonic analogues to the conserved quantities associated with strong interactions: strangeness and isobaric spin.},

We illustrate the impact on limits of commonly used treatments of these uncertainties with a simulated Higgs search. We adopt a "worst-case scenario" for the perturbative uncertainties.

Using data from previous editions, plus 2158 new measurements from 551 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We also summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as Higgs bosons, heavy neutrinos, and supersymmetric particles. All the particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We also give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as the Standard Model, particle detectors, probability, and statistics. Among the 108 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised including those on neutrino mass, mixing, and oscillations, QCD, top quark, CKM quark-mixing matrix, $V_{ud}$ \& $V_{us}$, $V_{cb}$ \& $V_{ub}$, fragmentation functions, particle detectors for accelerator and non-accelerator physics, magnetic monopoles, cosmological parameters, and big bang cosmology. A booklet is available containing the Summary Tables and abbreviated versions of some of the other sections of this full Review.

It has been found useful to divide the quantities which are irreducible against Lorentz transformations into four symmetry classes which have a commutable multiplication like $+1,-1,+ε,-ε$ with $ε^2=1$.},

  Abstract                 = {At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), numerous events containing a Z boson decaying into two muons are produced. In many of these events, the Z boson is boosted and balanced in transverse momentum by exactly one jet. Since the kinematical properties of the muons can be measured very precisely with the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector, such events are ideal candidates for a data driven technique for the absolute jet energy scale determination and calibration.},

Die Reduktion der komplex aufgebauten Materie der Atomkerne und Nukleonen auf wenige Grundbausteine und Wechselwirkungen ist die erste Botschaft dieses Buchs. Der zweite Teil, der den Aufbau von Nukleonen und Kernen aus diesen Grundbausteinen beschreibt, machtdeutlich, dass Komplexität, die aus der Vielkörperwechselwirkung entsteht, in immer größerem Maß die Gesetzmäßigkeiten der zusammengesetzten Systeme bestimmt. Behandelt wird die Kernmaterie bei hohen Temperaturen und die Rolle von Kern- und Teilchenphysik bei astrophysikalischen Vorgängen. Die neue Auflage bietet stark überarbeitete Übungsaufgaben und eine ganze Reihe von Ergänzungen und Verbesserungen, besonders in der Neutrinophysik und beim doppelten Betazerfall. Das in straffem und klarem Stil abgefasste Lehrbuch eignet sich gut als Begleittext zu den einführenden Vorlesungenan Hochschulen.},

  Abstract                 = {I describe a framework for the presentation of search results which is motivated by frequentist statistics. The most well-known use of this framework is for the combined search for the Higgs boson at LEP. A toy neutrino oscillations experiment is used to illustrate the rich information available in the framework for exclusion and discovery. I argue that the so-called CLs technique for setting limits is appropriate for determining exclusion intervals while the determination of confidence intervals advocated by Feldman and Cousins' method is more appropriate for treating established signals, i.e. going beyond discovery to measurement.
